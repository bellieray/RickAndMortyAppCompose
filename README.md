## Tech Stacks

This project uses many of the popular libraries, plugins and tools of the android ecosystem.

- [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)

- [Material](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-material) - Build Jetpack Compose UIs with ready to use Material Design Components.

- [Foundation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-foundation) - Write Jetpack Compose applications with ready to use building blocks and extend foundation to build your own design system pieces.

- [UI](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-ui) - Fundamental components of compose UI needed to interact with the device, including layout, drawing, and input.



- [Lifecycle-ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/lifecycle) - Perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments.

- [Paging](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview) - The Paging Library makes it easier for you to load data gradually and gracefully within your app's [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView).

- [Glide](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/int/compose.html) -Glide is a fast and efficient image loading library for Android focused on smooth scrolling. Glide offers an easy to use API, a performant and extensible resource decoding pipeline and automatic resource pooling.

- [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)

- [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx) - Major improvement to the original Android [Support Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/index), which is no longer maintained.

- [Lifecycle](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - Perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments.

- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. The ViewModel class allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.

- [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - Provides an abstraction layer over SQLite used for offline data caching.

- [Paging3](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview) - The Paging Library makes it easier for you to load data gradually and gracefully within your app's [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView).

- Others

- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)

- [OkHttp-Logging-Interceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor/README.md) - Logs HTTP request and response data.

- [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) - Library Support for coroutines.

- [Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) - Flows are built on top of coroutines and can provide multiple values.

- [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/android/docs/getting-started/) - Build awesome beautiful UIs.

- [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) - Library Support for coroutines,provides runBlocking coroutine builder used in tests.

- [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) - A modern JSON library for Kotlin and Java.




## Gradle

- [Version Catalog](https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-catalogs) - Gradle version catalogs enable you to add and maintain dependencies and plugins in a scalable way. Using Gradle version catalogs makes managing dependencies and plugins easier when you have multiple modules.



### Features

- Multi-module architecture

- Displays a list of Rick and Morty characters retrieved from a [public API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/).

- Provides detailed information for each character, including name, image, and description.

- Uses Jetpack Compose to build the UI.

- UseCase / Repository / DataSource logics are best practises from clean architecture..

- Uses MVVM architecture to manage the app's UI and data.

- Uses Coroutines and Flow for asynchronous operations.

- Uses Hilt for dependency injection.



## TODO

- Write unit test

- Write UI test
